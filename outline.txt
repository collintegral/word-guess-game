Things the game needs to do

1a. Pick a word at random from a repository of contextually-appropriate words.
1b. (OPTIONAL) Build an array of already-used words; don't repeat words until all have been used.

2. Build a display that explains the game, shows the hidden word as underscores, and shows wins and losses.

3a. Request and receive a letter input from the user.
3b. Make sure that input has not already been used. Ignore it if it has.

4. Compare that input to each letter of the hidden word.

5a. If the letter matches one, fill that in on the hidden word.
5b. If the letter doesn't match, give a strike and place it in the "wrong" category.

6a. If the hidden word is fully revealed, congratulate the user and offer to start over. Add one to the win count.
6b. If too many strikes are accrued, inform the user of their loss and offer to start over. Add one to the loss count.
6c. (OPTIONAL) Additionally offer to reset the game at the entry display, clearing wins and losses.
